# KrishiGPT
Farmers often face crop losses due to diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Identifying these diseases early is crucial, but not all farmers have access to agricultural experts. A mobile/web-based system that detects plant diseases through image analysis can bridge this gap and empower farmers with instant insights.
# 🌾 KrishiGPT – Smart Farming AI Chatbot

**KrishiGPT** is an intelligent, AI-powered chatbot designed specifically for farmers. It offers instant support on crop diseases, fertilizers, weather updates, and helps locate nearby agricultural shops through Google Maps integration. Built with a user-friendly web interface and powered by conversational AI, this project aims to bridge the knowledge gap for Indian farmers using accessible technology.
