# KrishiGPT
Farmers often face crop losses due to diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Identifying these diseases early is crucial, but not all farmers have access to agricultural experts. A mobile/web-based system that detects plant diseases through image analysis can bridge this gap and empower farmers with instant insights.
